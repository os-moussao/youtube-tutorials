# Overview
This repository contains the code for tutorials I make in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@osmann1337).

# Running the code
In case you want to clone and run the code, make sure to have `uv` installed and run `uv sync` to install the dependencies.

For running jupyter labs, `uv run jupyter lab` is the way to go. Alternatively, you can run the notebooks directly in vscode if you have python extensions installed.
